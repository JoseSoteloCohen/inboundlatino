## About Me

> I'm an ex-marketer that fell in love of Software Development while doing SEO and trying to develop new growth strategies for business of all sizes.

Now I work full-time developing and having fun with projects of all kind, from building cool stuff in React @ Moosend to small websites and WordPress plugins for small businesses.
